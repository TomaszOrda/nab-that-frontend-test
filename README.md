[Preview on Vercel](https://nabthat-frontend-test.vercel.app)

# Recruitment task

The recruitment task was done in Angular. I have not had any experience with this framework before, in effect certain parts of the code might not be up to the highest standard. Completion of the tasks follows:

## MAIN GOAL

I have finished all the main tasks and followed all the criteria.

## ADDITIONAL GOALS

I have finished most of the additional goals. Remaining one were not finished due to lack of experience and time.
