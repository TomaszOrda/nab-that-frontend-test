[Preview on Vercel](https://nabthat-frontend-test.vercel.app)

A recruitment task I have done in 2024. It was previously forked from the company repository, however, the repository was deleted (long past the deadline for the task of course). Thus I recreatad the repository so it does not point at some else solution.

The `/projekt` folder contains the design speifications. The [list of completed tasks](task-completion.md) gives also a general idea about what were the backend specifications.

I decided to keep this repository as a part of my portfolio and also as a reference for my future projects.
